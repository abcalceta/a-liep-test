The Asia-Pacific Library and Information Education and Practice Conference is a biennial international conference held within the Asia-Pacific Region. The idea arose at the Library and Information Professions Education Renewal (LIPER) Workshop in November of 2004. Dr. Christopher Khoo of Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore met with Dr. Chihfeng P. Lin of Shih-Hsin University, Taiwan and agreed on the need for an Asian LIS Education Conference. Dr. Khoo then enlisted the help of Abdus Sattar Chaudhry also from NTU and Dr. Diljit Singh of the University of Malaya, Malaysia to make the first A-LIEP Conference happen in 2006.

> The LIS profession in Asia-Pacific has often looked to the West for ideas and leadership.  LIS educators and professionals in the region are often unaware of valuable developments, innovations, and expertise in neighboring countries.  Each country in Asia-Pacific has its own history of LIS education and research, shaped by socio-economic, political, and cultural factors. As a result, LIS education and research in Asia-Pacific exhibit a wide variety of characters, flavors and areas of strength.  There is much we can learn from one another.  This conference will allow each country to tell its story of LIS, and facilitate dialogue and knowledge sharing.

From 2006, A-LIEP has been to eight countries and nine conferences have been conducted. Various topics have been discussed revolving around LIS Education, LIS Practice, and LIS Research. The conference was hosted by LIS Schools and attended mostly by LIS educators, students, and practitioners with notable keynote speakers and guests. Through its various iterations, the A-LIEP conference continues to be a venue for discovery, collaboration, and acknowledgement of the unique flavor of LIS in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on what we have in our own countries, what we can share to our colleagues in the region, and how we can help each other.
A-LIEP marks a milestone this 2021 for its 10th conference and its first ever virtual event co-hosted by Library & Information Science Program, University of Hawaii, School of Library and Information Studies, University of the Philippines, School of Information Management, Victoria University of Wellington, Graduate Institute of Information Studies, National Taiwan Normal University, Department of Library Science, Chulalongkorn University, and Wee Kim Wee School of Information and Communication, Nanyang Technological University.
