The 12th A-LIEP conference theme is LIS Education, Research, and Practice: Ethics, Sustainability, and Social Responsibility. This conference aims to bring together practitioners, researchers, and LIS educators to explore and discuss how LIS education and practice in the Asia-Pacific region can contribute to building ethical and sustainable knowledge societies that foster equitable access, responsible information management, and community engagement.  We invite papers that discuss any of the following sub-themes: Exploring and addressing ethical issues in LIS education, research, and practice; Sustainability concerns and practices in library and archival services, including green libraries and digital preservation; Social responsibility and advocacy in LIS, including diversity, equity, and inclusion; Responsible data governance, open access, and digital rights; The role of LIS education in contributing to the attainment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); Decolonizing LIS curricula, LIS practices and knowledge practices; and AI, automation, and ethical considerations in LIS professions.

The conference is an in-person event and will be held at the University of the Philippines Bonifacio Global City Campus.

## Tracks and Integration Sessions
The conference will feature full and short research paper presentations on the following main topics/themes: LIS Education, LIS Practice, LIS Research. There will be two integration sessions and these are: a) Education and Pedagogy Panel  and b) Student Research Ideathon where students can discuss potential research projects, collaborate, and learn from one another.

The track on Education and Pedagogy, which was introduced in 2021, provides a venue for discussions relating to pedagogy, curriculum, tenure, promotion, and other matters relating to LIS educators and teaching.  We are inviting submissions of abstracts for discussion for a maximum of 3,000 words.
The Student Research Ideathon is a venue where students can participate and exchange ideas on how to draft research proposals and conduct research.  This can be an opportunity for students to get research collaborators, or suggestions for improvement of their proposals, or ideas for their future research.  We are inviting proposals from students/alumni who have already completed their research or students who currently are in the stages of drafting proposals to share their experiences, issues, roadblocks, best practices, etc.
