The conference will feature full and short research paper presentations on the following main topics/themes: LIS Education, LIS Practice, LIS Research. There will be two integration sessions and these are: a) Education and Pedagogy Panel  and b) Student Research Ideathon where students can discuss potential research projects, collaborate, and learn from one another.

The track on Education and Pedagogy, which was introduced in 2021, provides a venue for discussions relating to pedagogy, curriculum, tenure, promotion, and other matters relating to LIS educators and teaching.  We are inviting submissions of abstracts for discussion for a maximum of 3,000 words.
The Student Research Ideathon is a venue where students can participate and exchange ideas on how to draft research proposals and conduct research.  This can be an opportunity for students to get research collaborators, or suggestions for improvement of their proposals, or ideas for their future research.  We are inviting proposals from students/alumni who have already completed their research or students who currently are in the stages of drafting proposals to share their experiences, issues, roadblocks, best practices, etc.
