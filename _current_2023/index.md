# A-LIEP 2023 in Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.

The 11th Asia Pacific Library and Information Education and Practice (A-LIEP) Conference was held on December 5-7, 2023 at the National Central Library, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C. The conference was co-located with the International Conference on Asia-Pacific Digital Libraries (ICADL) and the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific chapter of iSchools (AP iSchools) under a collective title 2023 International Forum on Data, Information, and Knowledge for Resilient and Trustworthy Digital Societies. The conference focused on the challenges, opportunities, drivers and innovations in LIS education, research, and practice that were experienced and encountered by individuals and institutions to adapt and survive the recent pandemic and moving forward to the post-pandemic. The implementation of remote teaching and learning, application of alternative research methods, and dependency on online information services has brought about issues in inequalities of information access and use, injustices and abuses in creation and dissemination of information, misinformation, censorship, and control of the narrative by the powerful. On the other hand, new practices and processes have emerged and alternative research and teaching methods have been effected during these times that showed the resilience of the field, the educators, researchers and practitioners. The conference provides the venue for the discussion of such issues, realizations, and innovations in the context of information use, information professions, libraries, LIS education, and LIS research. The conference was an on-site, in-person event, but options to join and present online for those who cannot attend onsite were made available.
